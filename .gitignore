# pyenv
#   For a library or binary, you wish to ignore these files.
#   For a full application, you probably want to include these.

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or even
#   fail to install them. In that case, the lock file should be added to .gitignore.
#Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
